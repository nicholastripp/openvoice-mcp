### 5. Multi-Turn Conversation End Phrase Detection Fix

Fixed critical bug where end phrases weren't terminating conversations:

**Issues Resolved:**
- End phrases now properly terminate sessions
- Multi-language support for 6 languages
- Fixed session state conflicts
- Proper handling of transcription events

**Supported Languages:**
- English: "stop", "goodbye", "that's all", "end session"
- German: "stopp", "ende", "tschüss", "das war's"
- Spanish: "parar", "adiós", "eso es todo"
- French: "arrêter", "au revoir", "c'est tout"
- Italian: "ferma", "arrivederci", "basta così"
- Dutch: "stop", "tot ziens", "dat is alles"

**Improvements:**
- Single-word "stop" ends conversation (doesn't control devices)
- "Stop the [device]" properly controls devices
- No more stuck states after end phrases
- Clear session termination and return to wake word
