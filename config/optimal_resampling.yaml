      cpu_affinity: null # Let OS manage
      priority: 0        # Normal priority
      
  # Implementation notes
  implementation:
    - Replace signal.resample with signal.resample_poly in src/audio/capture.py
    - Calculate GCD for up/down factors to minimize computation
    - Pre-calculate factors during initialization for efficiency
    - Consider caching filter coefficients for repeated use
    - Monitor for potential edge effects at chunk boundaries
    
  # Fallback configuration (if polyphase fails)
  fallback:
    method: scipy_fft
    display_name: SciPy FFT
    library: scipy.signal.resample
    notes: Current implementation - known to work but slower
