# Wake Word Model Stuck State Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The OpenWakeWord model was getting stuck returning the exact same confidence value `5.0768717e-06` repeatedly, preventing wake word detection from working properly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Floating Point Comparison Issue**: Exact equality check for floating point values
2. **Threading/Concurrency Issues**: Model accessed from multiple threads without synchronization
3. **Incomplete Model Reset**: Reset logic not always performing complete model reload
4. **Audio Buffer Management**: Potential buffer corruption or invalid chunk sizes
5. **Model State Corruption**: OpenWakeWord internal state getting corrupted

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Floating Point Comparison (Lines 684-688, 939-943)
- Replaced exact equality check `if confidence == 5.0768717e-06`
- Now uses tolerance-based comparison: `if abs(confidence - known_stuck_value) < tolerance`
- Tolerance set to `1e-12` for reliable detection

### 2. Thread Synchronization
- Added `self.model_lock = threading.Lock()` (line 55)
- Protected all model access with lock:
  - Model predictions (line 659)
  - Model creation (line 455)
  - Model deletion (line 1120)
  - Model reset (line 1142)
  - Test predictions (line 475)
  - Warmup predictions (line 561)

### 3. Improved Model Reset (Line 1113)
- Extended complete model reload to include `prediction_timeout` reason
- Ensures full model recreation for stuck states, known stuck values, and timeouts

### 4. Audio Buffer Validation (Lines 281-284)
- Added chunk size validation before queuing
- Logs warning and skips invalid chunks
- Prevents feeding incorrect chunk sizes to model

### 5. Faster Stuck Detection
- Reduced `stuck_detection_threshold` from 10 to 5 (line 78)
- Reduced `prediction_timeout` from 5.0s to 2.0s (line 93)
- Reduced `max_hung_predictions` from 5 to 3 (line 96)

## Expected Benefits

1. **Faster Recovery**: Model will detect and recover from stuck states in 5 predictions instead of 10
2. **Thread Safety**: Prevents race conditions during model access
3. **Better Detection**: Tolerance-based comparison catches slight variations in stuck value
4. **Reliable Reset**: Complete model reload for all stuck scenarios
5. **Clean Audio**: Invalid chunks filtered out before processing

## Testing Recommendations

1. Monitor logs for `[RESET]` entries to verify reset behavior
2. Check for `KNOWN STUCK VALUE DETECTED` messages
3. Verify wake word detection works after model has been running
4. Watch for the specific stuck value `5.0768717e-06` in logs

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Raspberry Pi for testing
2. Monitor wake word detection performance
3. Adjust tolerance values if needed
4. Consider adding more known stuck values if discovered
