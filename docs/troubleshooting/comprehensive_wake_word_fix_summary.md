# Comprehensive Wake Word Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. VAD Immediate Timeout After Wake Word Detection
**Problem**: Voice Activity Detection timed out immediately after wake word, not giving user time to speak.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added 2-second grace period before starting VAD timeout (lines 1175-1177 in main.py)
- Now waits total of 7 seconds (2s grace + 5s detection) before timing out
- Lowered OpenAI VAD threshold from 0.5 to 0.3 for more sensitive detection

### 2. Subsequent Wake Words Not Detected
**Problem**: After first detection, subsequent wake words had very low confidence (0.000005-0.000068).

**Root Causes Found**:
- **Cooldown blocking**: 2-second cooldown was preventing rapid wake word attempts
- **Model getting stuck**: After reset, model returns to stuck state quickly

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added clear logging to show when cooldown blocks detection (line 861-862 in detector.py)
- Added audio capture state verification after session end (lines 570-576 in main.py)
- Audio streaming logging to verify pipeline is working

### 3. Model Frequently Gets Stuck at 5.0768717e-06
**Root Cause**: The hey_jarvis model file appears to be corrupted.

**Evidence**:
- Model returns exact value 5.0768717e-06 for all predictions
- Value persists even after model reset
- Occurs with varied audio input (different RMS levels)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added immediate reset when stuck value detected (bypasses cooldown)
- Added model integrity check on load (lines 477-482 in detector.py)
- Changed default model from "hey_jarvis" to "alexa" in config.yaml
- Added audio format validation (chunk size, dtype, range)

## Key Changes Made

### main.py
1. Added 2s grace period before VAD timeout starts
2. Added audio capture state logging after session end
3. Audio streaming to OpenAI already has comprehensive logging

### wake_word/detector.py
1. Bypass cooldown timer for stuck state detection
2. Force immediate reset for value 5.0768717e-06
3. Reduced thresholds: stuck detection 5→3, cooldown 10s→2s
4. Added audio format validation (chunk size, dtype, range checks)
5. Added model corruption detection on load
6. Enhanced cooldown blocking logs

### openai_client/realtime.py
1. Lowered VAD threshold from 0.5 to 0.3

### config/config.yaml
1. Changed default wake word from "hey_jarvis" to "alexa"
2. Added notes about model corruption issue

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Wake word detection**: Should work with "alexa" instead of corrupted "hey_jarvis"
2. **VAD timeout**: User has 2 seconds to start speaking after wake word
3. **Model resets**: Immediate reset when stuck value detected
4. **Clear diagnostics**: Logs show exactly why detections fail (cooldown, threshold, stuck)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Test with "alexa" wake word model
2. **If hey_jarvis needed**: Reinstall OpenWakeWord models to fix corruption
3. **Monitor logs for**:
   - "CRITICAL: WAKE WORD MODEL IS CORRUPTED"
   - "WAKE WORD BLOCKED BY COOLDOWN"
   - "WAITING FOR USER TO SPEAK"
   - Audio format validation errors

## Remaining Investigation

The root cause of hey_jarvis model corruption needs investigation:
- Could be corrupted model file on disk
- Could be incompatible model version
- Could be Raspberry Pi specific issue

Testing with "alexa" model will help isolate if it's model-specific or systemic.
