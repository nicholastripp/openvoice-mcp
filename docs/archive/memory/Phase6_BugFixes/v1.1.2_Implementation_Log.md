# Phase 6: Bug Fixes and Improvements (v1.1.2)

## Overview
This phase focused on fixing various bugs discovered after the v1.1.1 security release, improving the --skip-ha-check functionality, and enhancing the user experience.

## Date Range
- Start: 2025-07-19
- End: 2025-07-19

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. MCP Test Script Compatibility
- **Problem**: The test_ha_connection.py script was using the deprecated Conversation API
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote the script to use the new MCP architecture
- **Files Modified**: `/examples/test_ha_connection.py`

### 2. Web UI Improvements
- **Audio Test Page**: Fixed poor text contrast (light gray on white background)
- **Wake Word Instructions**: Added helpful text with link to Picovoice Console
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/src/web/templates/config/audio_test.html`
  - `/src/web/templates/config/yaml.html`

### 3. --skip-ha-check Flag Fixes
Multiple issues were discovered and fixed:
- **Issue 1**: Flag only worked when HA connection failed
- **Issue 2**: OpenAI connection failed when no tools were available
- **Issue 3**: No audio output despite wake word and recording working

**Solutions**:
- Moved skip check before connection attempt
- Only set tool_choice when tools are actually registered
- Restructured OpenAI initialization to always set up event handlers

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/main.py`
- `/src/openai_client/realtime.py`

### 4. Shutdown and Cleanup
- **MCP SSE Error**: Fixed scary traceback on Ctrl+C
- **Solution**: Improved signal handling and graceful cleanup
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/src/main.py`
  - `/src/services/ha_client/mcp_official.py`

### 5. Documentation
- **README License**: Updated from "TBD" to proper MIT license reference
- **Files Modified**: `/README.md`

## Technical Details

### OpenAI Client Fix
The main issue was that `tool_choice: "auto"` was being set even with no tools:
```python
# Before (always set):
self.session_config["tool_choice"] = "auto"

# After (conditional):
if len(self.session_config["tools"]) == 1 and not self.text_only:
    self.session_config["tool_choice"] = "auto"
```

### Signal Handler Improvement
Changed from creating new asyncio task to setting shutdown event:
```python
# Before:
asyncio.create_task(assistant.stop())

# After:
assistant._shutdown_event.set()
```

## Lessons Learned
1. Always test with edge cases like --skip-ha-check
2. Signal handling in asyncio requires careful consideration
3. UI/UX details like text contrast matter for accessibility
4. Keep documentation (like license sections) consistent

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any additional bugs
- Consider adding automated tests for the fixed scenarios
- Update installation documentation if needed
