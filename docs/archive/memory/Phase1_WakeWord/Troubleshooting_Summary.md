# Wake Word Detection Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Fixed
1. **Audio gain integer overflow** - Fixed casting issue that caused audio distortion
2. **Data type mismatch** - Porcupine expects Python list, not numpy array (fixed)
3. **Sensitivity misunderstanding** - Corrected to use 1.0 (maximum sensitivity)
4. **Audio quality** - Implemented scipy resampling for better quality
5. **Configuration** - Changed from "jarvis" to "picovoice" for easier detection

## Current Status
- Porcupine is receiving audio correctly
- Audio levels are very low (max ~1000 after 2.0x gain)
- No wake word detections occurring
- System is technically working but audio input may be too quiet

## Remaining Issues
1. **Microphone gain too low** - Audio levels reaching Porcupine are below typical speech levels
   - Normal speech should be 5000-20000 range
   - Current levels: 100-1000 (too quiet)

2. **Possible microphone configuration issue** on Raspberry Pi
   - May need to adjust ALSA mixer settings
   - Could be using wrong input device

## Next Steps
1. Check microphone gain settings on Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   alsamixer  # Adjust capture levels
   ```

2. Verify correct input device:
   ```bash
   arecord -l  # List devices
   arecord -D plughw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -d 5 test.wav  # Test recording
   ```

3. Test with pre-recorded audio file containing "picovoice" to verify Porcupine works

4. Consider increasing audio_gain to 5.0 or higher if microphone is genuinely quiet
