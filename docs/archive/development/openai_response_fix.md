# OpenAI Response Fix

## Summary

Fixed the issue where OpenAI was not responding after wake word detection. The system was sending audio continuously but responses were failing with status "failed".

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging (src/openai_client/realtime.py)
- Added comprehensive error logging for failed responses
- Now logs full error details including type, code, and message
- Emits `response_failed` event for handling in main app

### 2. Explicit Response Creation (src/main.py)
- Added explicit `response.create` call after `speech_stopped` event
- Server VAD only commits the audio buffer, doesn't automatically generate response
- Added 0.1s delay to ensure buffer is committed before requesting response

### 3. Fixed Continuous Audio Sending
- Re-added `SessionState.PROCESSING` to blocked states
- Prevents continuous audio streaming after speech is detected
- Stops audio transmission immediately when VAD triggers

### 4. Response Creation Fallback
- Added 2-second fallback timer after speech detection
- If no response is created within 2s, triggers another `response.create`
- Ensures responses are generated even if initial request fails

### 5. Response Retry Logic
- Added handler for `response_failed` events
- Retries response creation for temporary failures
- Ends session for non-retryable errors

## Technical Details

### The Root Cause
1. Server VAD was detecting speech and committing the audio buffer
2. But no `response.create` event was being sent to generate a response
3. Audio continued streaming even after speech detection
4. Responses that were attempted failed with truncated error messages

### The Solution
1. Explicitly request response creation after speech detection
2. Stop audio streaming when speech is detected (PROCESSING state)
3. Add fallback timer to ensure responses are created
4. Log complete error details for failed responses
5. Retry failed responses when possible

## Testing Notes

The system should now:
1. Detect wake word ("picovoice")
2. Start listening for user speech
3. Detect when user stops speaking (VAD)
4. Stop audio transmission
5. Request response from OpenAI
6. Play audio response back to user
7. End session or continue for multi-turn conversation
