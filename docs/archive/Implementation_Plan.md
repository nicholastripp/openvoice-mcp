## Note on Handover Protocol

For long-running projects or situations requiring context transfer (e.g., exceeding LLM context limits, changing specialized agents), the APM Handover Protocol should be initiated. This ensures smooth transitions and preserves project knowledge. Detailed procedures are outlined in the framework guide:

`prompts/01_Manager_Agent_Core_Guides/05_Handover_Protocol_Guide.md`

The current Manager Agent or the User should initiate this protocol as needed.
