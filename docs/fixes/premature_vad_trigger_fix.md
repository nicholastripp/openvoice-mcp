# Premature VAD Trigger Fix

## Problem
When the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket connection is established, it immediately creates a session and starts listening for voice activity. This causes premature VAD (Voice Activity Detection) triggers that occur before the user is actually ready to speak, leading to:

- "Session start" messages appearing too early
- VAD events firing within 1.5 seconds of connection
- Poor user experience where the system seems to activate before the wake word

## Root Cause
The OpenAI Realtime API begins processing audio and detecting speech immediately upon session creation. The session is created as soon as the WebSocket connects, which happens before:
1. The wake word detection completes
2. The user hears confirmation feedback
3. The initial VAD sensitivity adjustment period

## Solution
We implemented a session readiness tracking system:

1. **Session Ready Flag**: Added `session_ready` flag to the OpenAI client that starts as `False`
2. **Event Filtering**: VAD events (`speech_started` and `speech_stopped`) are ignored when `session_ready` is `False`
3. **Delayed Readiness**: Session is marked ready only after the 2-second initial VAD adjustment period
4. **Double-Check**: Main application also verifies session readiness before processing speech events

## Implementation Details

### OpenAI Client Changes
- Added `session_ready` and `session_created_time` tracking
- Filter VAD events in `_handle_event()` based on readiness
- Added `mark_session_ready()` method
- Reset readiness state on disconnect/reconnect

### Main Application Changes
- Check `session_ready` in `_on_speech_stopped()` handler
- Mark session ready in `_adjust_vad_after_delay()` after 2 seconds
- Enhanced logging to track session lifecycle

## Timeline
1. Wake word detected
2. WebSocket connects → Session created (not ready)
3. Initial VAD settings applied (less sensitive)
4. 2-second delay
5. Session marked ready → VAD adjusted to normal
6. User can now speak and VAD events will be processed

This ensures a smooth user experience where the system only responds to actual user speech after they're ready.
