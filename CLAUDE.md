# CLAUDE.md - Comprehensive Development Rules

This file provides comprehensive guidance to Claude Code when working with code in any repository. These rules are organized by category and should be referenced based on the specific development context.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy & Principles

**Reference**: [core-philosophy.md](.claude/rules/core-philosophy.md)

- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions
- **Iterate**: Prefer iterating on existing code rather than building from scratch
- **Focus**: Concentrate on the specific task assigned
- **Quality**: Strive for clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding style throughout the project

## 🗣️ Communication Guidelines

**Reference**: [communication-rules.md](.claude/rules/communication-rules.md)

- Split responses when necessary for clarity
- Clearly indicate suggestions vs. applied fixes
- Use check-ins for large tasks to confirm understanding
- Track lessons learned in documentation

## 💻 Implementation Workflow

**Reference**: [implementation-workflow.md](.claude/rules/implementation-workflow.md)

### ACT/Code Mode Protocol
1. **Analyze Code**: Dependency analysis, flow analysis, impact assessment
2. **Plan Code**: Structured proposals with clear reasoning
3. **Make Changes**: Incremental rollouts with simulation validation
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing procedures
5. **Loop**: Repeat systematically for all changes
6. **Optimize**: Performance and code quality improvements
7. **Checkpointing**: Named milestones with version control
8. **Progress Recording**: Document implementation status

- Follow established project structure conventions
- Organize files logically by functionality
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document structure decisions

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

**Reference**: [security.md](.claude/rules/security.md)

- Follow security best practices
- Conduct security audits for sensitive changes
- Never expose secrets or sensitive data
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs
- Use secure communication protocols

## 📝 Documentation & Memory Management

**Reference**: [documentation-memory.md](.claude/rules/documentation-memory.md)

- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Update documentation with code changes
- Use memory files for project continuity
- Document architectural decisions

## 🔄 Version Control & Environment Management

**Reference**: [version-control.md](.claude/rules/version-control.md)

- Follow Git best practices
- Use appropriate branching strategies
- Maintain clean commit history
- Handle environment-specific configurations properly

## 📋 Planning & Project Management

**Reference**: [planning-workflow.md](.claude/rules/planning-workflow.md)

### PLAN/Architect Mode
- Systematic project analysis
- Requirement gathering and validation
- Strategic planning with stakeholder alignment
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## 🚀 Improvements & Optimization

**Reference**: [improvements-suggestions.md](.claude/rules/improvements-suggestions.md)

- Identify optimization opportunities
- Suggest performance improvements
- Recommend architectural enhancements
- Balance technical debt management

### Feature Implementation

- Launch parallel Tasks immediately upon feature reqquest
- Skip asking what type of implementation unless absolutely critical
- Always use 7-parallel-task method for efficiency

**Reference**: [feature-implementation.md](.claude/rules/feature-implementation.md)

## 🔧 Specialized Workflows

### APM (Agentic Project Management) Framework

When working with APM-based projects, reference these specialized guides:

- **[apm_impl_plan_critical_elements_reminder.md](.claude/rules/apm_impl_plan_critical_elements_reminder.md)**: Implementation plan checklist
- **[apm_memory_system_format_source.md](.claude/rules/apm_memory_system_format_source.md)**: Memory bank system setup
- **[apm_plan_format_source.md](.claude/rules/apm_plan_format_source.md)**: Implementation plan formatting
- **[apm_task_prompt_plan_guidance_incorporation_reminder.md](.claude/rules/apm_task_prompt_plan_guidance_incorporation_reminder.md)**: Task assignment guidance
- **[apm_discovery_synthesis_reminder.md](.claude/rules/apm_discovery_synthesis_reminder.md)**: Discovery and synthesis procedures
- **[apm_memory_naming_validation_reminder.md](.claude/rules/apm_memory_naming_validation_reminder.md)**: Memory validation procedures

### SWE-Bench Workflow

**Reference**: [swebench-workflow.md](.claude/rules/swebench-workflow.md)

- Specialized workflow for SWE-Bench challenges
- Issue analysis and solution development
- Testing and validation procedures

## 📚 Usage Guidelines

### Rule Application Priority

1. **Always Apply**: Core philosophy, communication rules, code quality
2. **Context-Specific**: Architecture, testing, security (based on project needs)
3. **Workflow-Specific**: APM framework, SWE-Bench (when explicitly required)

### File Reference Format

When referencing specific rules during development:
- Use the pattern `[rule-name.md](.claude/rules/rule-name.md)` for detailed guidance
- Reference specific sections for targeted guidance
- Combine multiple rules as needed for comprehensive coverage

### Integration with Project Structure

Prompts should be placed under `.claude/` directory
This CLAUDE.md file should be placed in your project root or `.claude/` directory structure: 

```
