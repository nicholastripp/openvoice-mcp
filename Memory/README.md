# Memory Bank - HA Realtime Assist Project

## Overview

This Memory Bank serves as the central repository for all agent activities, findings, and progress throughout the Home Assistant Realtime Voice Assistant development project. The structure is organized by development phases to facilitate easy navigation and context preservation.

## Directory Structure

```
/Memory/
├── Phase1_WakeWord/         # Wake word detection stabilization
├── Phase2_OpenAI/          # OpenAI API integration refinement  
├── Phase3_HomeAssistant/   # Home Assistant device control
└── Phase4_Integration/     # System testing and documentation
```

## Log File Organization

### Phase 1: Wake Word Stabilization
- **Investigation_Log.md**: Research findings, debugging results, alternative solution evaluations
- **Implementation_Log.md**: Code changes, fixes applied, integration work
- **Testing_Log.md**: Test results, performance metrics, reliability data

### Phase 2: OpenAI API Integration
- **Audio_Optimization_Log.md**: Audio format findings, level adjustments, VAD optimization
- **Integration_Log.md**: API integration work, state management, WebSocket handling
- **Testing_Log.md**: Conversation flow tests, timing validation, error scenarios

### Phase 3: Home Assistant Integration
- **API_Integration_Log.md**: HA API implementation, device discovery, service calls
- **Device_Control_Log.md**: Device control logic, command mapping, response handling
- **Testing_Log.md**: End-to-end device control tests, command variations

### Phase 4: Integration & Documentation
- **System_Testing_Log.md**: Full system tests, performance benchmarks, latency measurements
- **Performance_Log.md**: Optimization work, resource usage, Pi-specific tuning
- **Documentation_Log.md**: Documentation creation progress, user guides, developer docs

## Log Entry Format

All log entries should follow this standardized format:

```markdown
## [Entry Type] - [Brief Title]

## Navigation Tips

1. Each phase directory contains specialized logs for different aspects of that phase
2. Logs are append-only - new entries should be added at the bottom
3. Use clear, descriptive titles for easy scanning
4. Include file paths and line numbers for code references
5. Cross-reference between logs when work spans multiple areas

## Critical Information

- **Project Goal**: Achieve production-ready voice assistant with >90% wake word reliability, <3s response latency
- **Target Platform**: Raspberry Pi (exclusive optimization)
- **Key Metrics**: Wake word detection rate, response latency, conversation stability
- **Timeline**: 30-day development sprint
