## [Initial State Analysis] - Current Audio Configuration
**Date**: 2024-11-29 (Project Start)
**Agent**: Manager_Agent  
**Status**: Completed

### Summary
Documenting current audio configuration and known issues with OpenAI integration.

### Details
Current audio settings and issues:
- Format: PCM16, 24kHz, mono (correct specification)
- Chunk size: 1200 samples (50ms)
- Input volume: 5.0x multiplier
- Known issues:
  - "First 10 samples are very quiet" warnings
  - Inconsistent VAD triggering
  - Reports of garbled audio responses
  - Low RMS levels (0.002-0.005) in logs

### Next Steps
- Audio format validation implementation needed
- RMS level optimization required
- VAD threshold tuning pending
