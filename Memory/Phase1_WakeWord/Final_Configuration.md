# Final Wake Word Configuration

## Successful Configuration
After extensive testing with the TONOR G11 USB microphone and autonomous audio testing, the optimal configuration has been determined.

## Working Settings
```yaml
wake_word:
  engine: "porcupine"
  model: "picovoice"
  sensitivity: 1.0
  audio_gain: 1.0  # No amplification needed
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Audio Gain
- **Initial tests showed clipping** with gain > 1.0 due to loud ambient noise
- **Gain 1.0 (no amplification)** provides clean audio without distortion
- The TONOR microphone provides sufficient signal strength without amplification

### 2. Wake Word Detection Success
- **5 successful detections** during testing
- **"pea co voice" pronunciation** works best with macOS TTS
- Detection occurred at frame 126 (about 3.2 seconds after start)

### 3. Audio Levels
- With gain 1.0: Peak levels around 22,000 (good headroom)
- No clipping detected
- Clean audio signal for reliable detection

### 4. Testing Methodology
- Autonomous testing using macOS audio playback
- TONOR microphone successfully captured played audio
- Confirmed wake word detection works with proper speech input

## Pronunciation Guide
For "picovoice" wake word:
- ✅ "pea co voice" (best)
- ✅ "peek oh voice" 
- ❓ "pico voice" (may work)
- ❓ "picovoice" (single word - depends on accent)

## Next Steps
1. Main app is ready for production use
2. Users should speak clearly: "pea co voice"
3. Monitor logs for any clipping warnings
4. Adjust gain only if needed for specific environments

## Summary
The wake word detection system is now fully functional with:
- Porcupine engine
- TONOR G11 USB microphone
- No audio amplification (gain 1.0)
- Maximum sensitivity (1.0)
- Proper pronunciation guidance
