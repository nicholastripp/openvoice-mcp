# Wake Word Detection Visibility Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced wake word detection visibility and debugging in the main application to make it immediately obvious when wake words are detected and track the voice session flow.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Prominent Wake Word Detection Banner**
- Added visual banner with emojis when wake word is detected
- Shows wake word name and confidence level
- Clear indication that voice session is starting

### 2. **Audio Confirmation Beep**
- Plays 150ms beep at 600Hz when wake word is detected
- Provides immediate audio feedback to user
- Works in both test mode and production

### 3. **Wake Word Detection Counter**
- Tracks total wake word detections per session
- Helps identify if wake words are being detected but not processed
- Shows cumulative count with each detection

### 4. **Enhanced Wake Word Statistics**
- Tracks chunks processed, bytes received, and detection attempts
- Shows duration of audio processed
- Logs partial detection activity

### 5. **Session State Visual Indicators**
- Added emoji-based state indicators:
  - üî¥ IDLE - Waiting for wake word
  - üü° LISTENING - Speak your question
  - üü† PROCESSING - Analyzing speech
  - üü¢ RESPONDING - Generating answer
  - üîµ PLAYING - Response audio
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è COOLDOWN - Session ending
  - üîÑ MULTI-TURN - Ask follow-up
- Clear visual feedback for each state transition

### 6. **Configuration Fixes**
- Updated sensitivity from 0.5 to 1.0 (maximum for Porcupine)
- Fixed input_volume from 5.0 to 1.0 to prevent clipping
- Added clipping detection logging in audio capture

## Code Changes

### src/main.py
1. Enhanced `_on_wake_word_detected()`:
   - Added visual banner with centered text
   - Added detection counter
   - Added confirmation beep for all detections

2. Enhanced `_transition_to_state()`:
   - Added emoji-based state indicators
   - Visual banners for state transitions

3. Enhanced `_on_audio_captured_for_wake_word()`:
   - Added wake word statistics tracking
   - Better debug logging with duration info
   - Tracks partial detection attempts

### src/audio/capture.py
- Fixed missing input_volume application
- Added clipping detection when gain is applied
- Proper gain application before resampling

### config/config.yaml
- Updated sensitivity: 0.5 ‚Üí 1.0
- Updated input_volume: 5.0 ‚Üí 1.0
- Added comments explaining optimal values

## Testing the Improvements

When running the main app, you should now see:

1. **On startup**: Clear indication of wake word listening
2. **On wake word detection**: 
   ```
   ======================================================================
   üéôÔ∏è  WAKE WORD DETECTED!  üéôÔ∏è
   ======================================================================
                         Wake Word: picovoice
                      Confidence: 1.000000
   ======================================================================
   
   *** TOTAL WAKE WORD DETECTIONS THIS SESSION: 1 ***
   *** PLAYING CONFIRMATION BEEP ***
   ```

3. **State transitions**: Visual banners showing current state
4. **Debug output**: Periodic updates on wake word processing

## Next Steps

If wake words are still not being detected:
1. Check audio input levels with diagnostic scripts
2. Verify microphone is capturing speech properly
3. Test with different pronunciations of "picovoice"
4. Monitor logs for clipping warnings
